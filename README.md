# AI Hackathon Project: NLP Application Using LLM for Text Extraction

## Context
In this AI hackathon, our team developed an NLP application that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to extract information from unstructured data formats, such as PDF files. Our focus was on Financial Term Sheets, aiming to transform them into structured data.

## Tools Used
- **OpenAI**: Utilized for advanced NLP capabilities.
- **Azure OCR Computer Vision**: Employed to convert PDFs into text.
- **LangChain**: Integrated for efficient and effective text extraction.

## Main Scripts
1. **ocr.py**: Translates PDF files into text format, preparing the unstructured data for further processing.
2. **extraction.py**: Implements prompting strategies and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) techniques for accurate information extraction.
3. **export.py**: Exports the extracted data into a structured CSV format for ease of use and analysis.

## Achievements
We achieved an accuracy rate of 82% in correctly extracting and structuring the data from Financial Term Sheets.

## Understandings and Future Work
To further enhance the accuracy of our application, a key area of improvement is the `ocr.py` script along with the refinement of our prompting methods. We believe that by focusing on these aspects, we can significantly increase the performance and reliability of our NLP application.
