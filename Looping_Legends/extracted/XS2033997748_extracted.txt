Secondary Trading
Daily price indications including accrued interest (dirty) will be published on Reuters, Telekurs
and Bloomberg.
No representation is made as to the existence of a market for the Certificates. BNP Paribas
Arbitrage S.N.C. will endeavour to make a secondary market in the Certificates, subject to it
being satisfied that normal market conditions prevail. Any prices indicated will be dependent
upon factors affecting or likely to affect the value of the Certificates such as, but not limited to,
the remaining time to the Redemption Date, the outstanding principal amount, the Issuer's or, if
applicable, the Guarantor's credit risk, the performance and volatility of the underlying asset,
interest rates, exchange rates, credit spreads, and any incidental costs. To the extent BNP
Paribas Arbitrage S.N.C. holds Certificates that it can offer and subject to it being satisfied that
normal market conditions prevail, such prices will have a bid-offer spread no greater than 1%.
Holders should be aware that the secondary market price for any Certificate quoted on or after
the fourth (4th) Clearing System Business Day preceding any date on which the Issuer is due to
make a payment thereon, shall exclude the amount so payable per Certificate. The Holder of the
Certificates on the record date, as determined by the rules of the relevant Clearing System, shall
be entitled to receive or retain any such amount on the due date for payment thereof.
Initial Settlement
Delivery versus payment.
BNP Paribas Arbitrage S.N.C. will settle through Clearstream 81851.
Settlement must be made in Nominal.
Selling Restrictions
As set out in the Base Prospectus.

IMPORTANT INFORMATION
Investors Responsibilities
No action has been or will be taken in any jurisdiction that would, or is intended to, permit a public offering of the Certificates.
The Certificates are sold to investors on the understanding that they will comply with all relevant securities laws and public offer requirements in
the jurisdictions in which the Certificates are placed or resold, including, without limitation, the Prospectus Regulation and the relevant
applicable laws or regulations in any EU member state relating thereto.
Selling Restrictions
The Certificates may not be offered or sold in the United States or to U.S. persons at any time (as defined in regulation S under the U.S.
Securities Act of 1933 or the U.S. internal revenue code). The Certificates have not been and will not be registered under the U.S. Securities
Act of 1933, as amended, or the securities laws of any state in the United States, and are subject to U.S. tax requirements. In purchasing the
Certificates you represent and warrant that you are neither located in the United States nor a U.S. person and that you are not purchasing for
the account or benefit of any such person. The Certificates may not be offered, sold, transferred or delivered without compliance with all
applicable securities laws and regulations.
Risk Analysis
The Securities have no capital protection at any time and there can be a partial or total loss of any capital invested. Investment in the Securities
is therefore highly speculative and should only be considered by persons who can afford to lose their entire investment.
BNP Paribas is not providing the recipients of this document with any investment advice or recommendation to enter into any potential
transaction. Any purchaser of Certificates, other than a BNP Paribas counterparty or distributor, will be purchasing the Certificates from such
counterparty or distributor and will have no contractual relationship with BNP Paribas or any of its affiliates. In particular BNP Paribas will not be
responsible for assessing the appropriateness or suitability of an investment in the Certificates in relation to such third parties. This document
should be read together with the Base Prospectus and the applicable Final Terms for the Certificates. Any proposed issuance described in this
document cannot be fully assessed without a careful review of the terms and conditions contained in the Base Prospectus and the Final Terms.
In particular, potential investors should carefully read the sections headed "Risk Factors" in the Base Prospectus and the Final Terms for a full
description of the potential risks associated with the Certificates, and "Offering and Sale", for certain limitations on the purchase and onward
sales of the Certificates.
Any indicative price quotations, investment cases or market analysis contained in this document or any related marketing materials we may
have provided to you have been prepared on assumptions and parameters that reflect our good faith judgement or selection but must be
subject to your own independent analysis and due diligence before you make any investment decision. Please note that there can be conflicts
of interests between BNP Paribas and potential investors (see below) and we can therefore not assume any responsibility for the financial
consequences of your investment decision, which must be independent. We require that you undertake your own independent due diligence

you decide to purchase Certificates, you will be deemed to understand and accept the terms, conditions and risks associated with the
Certificates. You will also be deemed to act for your own account, to have made your own independent decision to purchase the Certificates
and to declare that such transaction is appropriate for you based upon your own judgement the advice from such advisers as you have deemed
necessary to consult. Each holder of the Certificates shall also be deemed to assume and be responsible for any and all taxes of any jurisdiction
or governmental or regulatory authority and should consult their own tax advisers in this respect.
You should note and assess for the purposes of any investment decision that members of the BNP Paribas group may face possible conflicts of
interest in connection with certain duties under the Certificates, such as trading in an underlying for their own account or for the account of
others, receiving fees in a number of capacities or taking market views which are not consistent with the objective of the Certificates.
Investors should note that BNP Paribas acting as Guarantor is licensed as a credit institution in France and as such is subject to the
new resolution regime introduced by the EU Bank Recovery and Resolution Directive of 15 May 2014. This new regulation, among
others, gives resolution authorities the power to amend the key terms of the Guarantee, to reduce the amounts payable by the
Guarantor under the terms of the Guarantee (including a reduction to zero) and convert the amounts due under the Guarantee into
shares or other securities. You may not be able to recover all or even part of the amount due under the Certificates (if any) from the
Guarantor under the Guarantee or you may receive a different security issued by the Guarantor (or another person) in place of the
amount (if any) due to you under the Certificates by the Issuer, which may be worth significantly less than the amount due to you
under the Certificates at expiry.
